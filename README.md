## What is REEFSCAPE?
![Crescendo Banner](assets/fd_frc_reefscape_wallpaper.png)

REEFSCAPE, presented by Haas, is the 2025 Season of the FIRST Robotics Competition. Each season has its unique objectives and limitations. 
Students have 6 weeks to construct a robot to compete in the season. Once the 6 weeks are up, teams compete at regional or district-level 
competitions (depending on region) to qualify for the FIRST Championship in Houston, Texas.
